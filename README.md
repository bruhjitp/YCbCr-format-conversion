The Y in YUV stands for "luma," which is brightness, or lightness, and black and white TVs decode only the Y part of the signal.
U and V provide color information and are "color difference" signals of blue minus luma (B-Y) and red minus luma (R-Y).
Through a process called "color space conversion," the video camera converts the RGB data captured by its sensors into either composite
analog signals (YUV) or component versions (analog YPbPr or digital YCbCr). For rendering on screen, all these color spaces must be
converted back again to RGB by the TV or display system.


Please go through the following blog to understand how we are making the conversion:
